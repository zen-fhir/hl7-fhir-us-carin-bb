There are no gaps because all used and unused codes are identified.\n\nThis code system consists of the following:\n\n*   FL 04 - Type of Bill Facility Codes\n*   FL 04 - Type of Bill Frequency Codes\n\nA code indicating the specific Type of Bill (TOB), e.g., hospital inpatient, outpatient, replacements, voids, etc. The first digit is a leading zero\\*. The fourth digit defines the frequency of the bill for the institutional and electronic professional claim.\n\nNote that with the advent of UB-04, the matrix methodology of constructing the first component of TOB codes according to digit position was abandoned in favor of specifying valid discrete codes. As a result, the first three digits in TOB have no underlying meaning.\n\nTo obtain the underlying code systems, please see information [here](https://www.nubc.org/subscription-information)",
